Back and forth before taking damage

Momentum Points, or MP
MP is depleted when attacked
When  your MP reaches 0, you are stunned for a turn, cannot dodge, and take more damage.
Support units regenerate 10 MP per turn.
Max MP is same as max HP.


Goes down when attacked
When MP > 0, reduces HP damage taken to a tiny fraction.
When MP = 0, you take much more HP damage.
Evasion is impossible at MP = 0!
Regain MP with Basic attacks
Spend MP with Heavy attacks

If MP>0
	If Evade
		MP -= MPdam*Attack/Defense
	Else
		(Attack/Defense*BasePower - Guard)/10
If MP=-
	(Attack/Defense*BasePower - Guard)/10*3

MPdam = 10 for Basic and Light. Heavy, Alt, and Special skills get +10.
